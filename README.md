"Project Description: Interactive Configuration Interface with Database Integration
This project aims to develop an interactive user interface (UI) for configuration management, connected to a database for data persistence, modification, and querying. The primary focus is on building a robust backend that efficiently handles interactions between the UI and the database.

Key Features:

Interactive User Interface: The configuration management system is built using Windows Forms to provide an easy-to-use, interactive experience for users. The UI allows users to input and modify configuration settings in a structured manner.

Database Integration: All configuration data is connected to a database for secure storage. This integration allows users to:

Save new configuration settings.
Modify existing configurations.
Query the database to retrieve specific configuration data.
Backend-Focused Development: Special emphasis is placed on the backend architecture. The backend ensures seamless communication between the user interface and the database, handling requests such as data saving, updating, and querying efficiently.

Queries and Data Manipulation: The project includes a set of custom queries to enable powerful data retrieval and manipulation, ensuring that the system can handle complex data management requirements."
